        <h3>What is Formula 1?</h3>
        <p>
            Formula 1 (F1) is the world's premier single-seat, open-wheel auto racing competition, featuring a global series of races called Grands Prix where top teams and drivers compete for a world championship. The "formula" in Formula 1 refers to the strict set of rules that all cars and competitors must follow, ensuring a level playing field for the highly advanced machines. F1 is known for its cutting-edge technology, pushing the boundaries of engineering and automotive innovation, with cars capable of reaching speeds over 200 mph.
